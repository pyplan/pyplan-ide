**Pyplan** provides a Python development environment intended for easily creating and deploying data analytics apps. Different than a Jupyter Notebook, where code is structured as a list of sentences, in Pyplan code is contained in nodes that work as calculation steps, organized in a hierarchical influence diagram. Nodes can be evaluated, and its result inspected through a console output or rendered as a table or graph. User interfaces are created dragging nodes on a canvas. Final apps can be shared with one click to general audience.

Among its most prominent features you will find:

- Assisted drag and drop graphical programming.
- Visual Influence Diagram to represent logic flow.
- Easy creation of interactive user interfaces.
- Empowered collaboration by one click publishing and sharing.
- Secure and scalable with corporate standards.
- On cloud or on-premise deployment.
